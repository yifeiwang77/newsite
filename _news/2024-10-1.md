6 papers were accepted to NeurIPS 2024. We inverstigated *how LLMs perform self-correction at test time* ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18634)), how to build *dynamic world models* through joint embedding methods ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18193)), how Transformers avoid feature collapse with LayerNorm and attention masks ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18781)), and why equivariant prediction of data corruptions helps learn good representations ([paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=NLqdudgBfy)).
