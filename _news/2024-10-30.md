3 new preprints are out, demystifying 1) why perplexity fails to represent long-context abilities of LLMs ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23771)), 2) how sparse autoencoders can potentially improve model robustness ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21331)), and 3) whether ICL can truly extrapolate to OOD scenarios ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09695)).
