3 new preprints are out, exploring 1) how existing long-context training of LLMs is problematic and how to address it ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23771)), 2) how sparse autoencoders can significantly improve robustness at noisy and few-shot scenarios ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21331)), and 3) whether ICL can truly extrapolate to OOD scenarios ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09695)).
