I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Stefanie Jegelka](https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/). 
I am interested in **principled**, **scalable**, and **safety-aware** machine learning algorithms for building **self-supervised foundation models**, with applications to vision, language, graph, and multimodal domains. 


My first-author papers were recognized by Best ML Paper Award of ECML-PKDD 2021, Silver Best Paper Award of ICML 2021 AdvML workshop, and Best Paper Award at ICML 2024 ICL workshop. In all, I have published 37 papers at top machine learning journals and conferences, 25 of which I am (co)-first author.

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2023, advised by [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io), [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), [Jiansheng Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69984.htm). Prior to that, I got my bachelor's degrees from PKU math and philosophy.


**I am on job market**. Feel free to reach out if interested.
