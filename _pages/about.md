I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Stefanie Jegelka](https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/). I am generally interested in understanding the underlying principles of foundation models and design theory-inspired algorithms to improve their capability and robustness. I have worked on multiple relevant areas including large language models, self-supervised learning, adversarial robustness, and graph representation learning.

My first-author papers received 3 best paper awards, including the sole Best ML Paper Award at ECML-PKDD 2021, the Silver Best Paper Award at the ICML 2021 AdvML workshop, and the Best Paper Award at the ICML 2024 ICL workshop.

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2023, advised by [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io), [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), [Jiansheng Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69984.htm). Prior to that, I got my bachelor's degrees from PKU math and philosophy.
